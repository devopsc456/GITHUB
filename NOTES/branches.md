## How to do fast-forward merge?

1. Create the branch `development` (or any name you provide) from `master`.  
2. By default, all files are copied from `master` to `development` branch.  
3. Modify any file and commit in `development` branch.  
4. Then go to `master` branch and run the below command to check the difference:

   ```bash
   git diff development
````

5. Then run the below command:

   ```bash
   git merge development
   ```

6. You may get a response like this:

   ```
   Updating 083fa89..d8cdd25
   Fast-forward
   java.txt | 1 +
   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   ```

## What is merge conflict?

ðŸ‘‰ A merge conflict happens when two developers update the **same file and the same line**.

### Steps to Reproduce and Resolve:

1. Update the file in `master` branch and commit the changes.

2. Update the same file in `development` branch and commit the changes.

3. Switch to `master` and run:

   ```bash
   git merge development
   ```

4. Resolve conflicts by **removing unused/conflicting lines**, then commit the changes.

git pull gitpartice master
```
